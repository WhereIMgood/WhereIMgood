### Hi there 👋

My name is 'Mysterious' and i like programming, its the only thing that i can express my creativity with.
I started learning it at the age of 10.
Now i'm 15.
### Why ? ❓
When i was young i didnt know how to release my unlimited energy, i tried so many stuff painting, drawing, making small cars using some small engines and batteries haha, but
it didnt work. As i remember, i was navigating the web and i was asking my self : how these websites works? but didnt find the answer by my self :'( . so i decided to search
for it and i learned some basic informations like html is the skull of the web and css and other stuff, and still a newbie, but i didnt give up because i knew that
programming is the only way to express my unlimited mysterious energy, so i started TheUltimateAdventure of learning web development.
2days, 3days, 4days, 1week, 1month, 5months... 5years.
It took me so much time to finally get a good expirience.

### An advice for beginners ⚠️
